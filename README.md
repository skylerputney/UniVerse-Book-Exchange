# UniVerse-Book-Exchange
The UNIverse is a university-based book marketplace.  

## Why should I care?

As books get increasingly expensive, students have to fork out more money every semester. Who wants to do that when you're just going to sell it back to the university in a few weeks? No one in their right mind should be forced to sell their books back for pennies on the dollar. 

Our book exchange aims to:
1. Cut out the university middle-man
2. Let students save more of their money by:
   * Buying books at a more reasonable price
   * Selling books with a better return margin

## Framework
Built on an MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework utilizing PHP

## Features

* Upload a book for sell at an arbitrary pricepoint and associated condition information
* Browse books to purchase
* Save books you're interested in for later
* Communicate with sellers to facilitate book purchase
